# Epam_InformationHandling
Text information handling using  composite,  chain of responsibility and interpreter patterns.
The disassembled text should be presented as an object containing, for example, paragraphs, sentences, lexemes, words, expressions,
symbols. The token is part of the text bounded by whitespace characters. To organize the data structure, use Composite.
The code that separates the text into its constituent parts must be formalized in the form of parser classes using
the Chain of Responsibility. The mathematical expressions found in the text must be calculated. And the final text must contain the
calculated value.
